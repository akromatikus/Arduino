------------Program List And Descriptions---------------

Inductor_Winder - Software that controls a solenoid winding device. The device uses a DC motor to spin an inductor bobbin, while a stepper motor guides the windings as they are wrapped around the bobbin.

Dual_Ultrasonic_Surface_Finder - This software controls two HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors mounted on an SG-90 servo. The servo rotates the sensors while they look for a surface in range. The binocular vision afforded by the sensors allows the device to track surfaces as they move.
